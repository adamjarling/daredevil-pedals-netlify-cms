the Real Cool Fuzz.

My take on the Stooges/Asheton fuzz tone, based on the Fuzzrite and heavily modded. here's the deal...   That ear piercing treble is rolled off while retaining the raunchy 60's  transistor fight the original silicon versions were legendary for.\
There is more depth to the tone and some cool subtle octave harmonic stuff going on about halfway through the dirt control.  Limited numbers...these have been discontinued so what's here is all that I have.  All hand wired in Chicago. True bypass, takes a battery or DC jack.
