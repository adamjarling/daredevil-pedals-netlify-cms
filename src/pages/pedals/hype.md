After 7 years of intense research & development, Daredevil is proud to launch the HYPE. The heart of this pedal is an FET boost capable of the most aggressive tones and volume. Excessive controls and components have been eliminated, less knobs = more tone!

This has nothing to do with "clean transparent boost" or any cork sniffing metaphors you may have heard. The HYPE is big and nasty in the best possible way. A boost that stacks and interacts great with other pedals…and built like a tank.

Best of all is the low street price of only $89... right on par with the mass produced brands, but who wants to play a pedal built overseas by robots when you can get the boutique quality real deal, all hand made in Chicago? Exactly.

So you can buy this for the high quality, or you can buy it because it sounds great, or just buy it because everyone else has one and that means you should too…After all… it's HYPE.

Specifics:

There is a small trim pot inside for output level, which is pre-set at a decent boost volume. Adjust to taste to find the sweet spot for your rig, stomp on it and go!

Runs on 9V DC power supply with negative ground (pin), any 100mA / "boss style" will be fine. I highly suggest a quality power brick with adequate filtering… the cheap plug sources and daisy chains will add noise and create potential problems with a boost of this output capability. Small power source noise + giant boost = loud noisy bad news.

Warranty Info: Daredevil covers repair or replacement of this unit for 2 years should it malfunction unless the damage occurred from operator misuse including incorrect power supply, any adjustment to inner components, or physical incurred damage. International customers check with dealer for warranty policies, shipping is not covered for out of USA claims.
