New Smaller size!!

THE ORIGINAL! Get all the great cocked wah sounds without the wah pedal. No more trying to engage and find the sweet spot during a solo. Just dial it in, crank up the gain, and you're ready to lay down some sweet, squawky tone.

What we have is a smooth sweeping wah with a single knob to set your pitch. A boost section has been added to give you more gain and power as needed. Balance these two features out with the Blend control, adjusting how much wah signal goes to output. Very cool for dialing in the cocked tone subtle enough to be left on all the time, or for just a bit of a frequency tweak. Full clockwise gives you the complete effect. The gain section is warm, loud, and gives a nice crunch to your amp's output. No need to try and hit a boost before hand, it's all there. Get the killer tones from the likes of Mick Ronson, Micheal Schenker, Slash, etc… Accept no substitutes.

Like all Daredevil pedals, this one is true bypass and can be run from a 9V battery or a power supply.
