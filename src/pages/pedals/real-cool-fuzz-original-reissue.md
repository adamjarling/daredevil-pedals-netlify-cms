title: Real Cool Fuzz - Original reissue
description: "Here is the original RCF that was released back in 2012. All silicon retro fuzz action that is equal parts gnarly gritty edge and raw garage power. A heavily modified take on the 60's Fuzzrite, but without the ear piercing treble issues and boasting a fatter gain and EQ.\_ These have been used on bass guitar on tour with Iggy in recent years, and definitely nail the early Stooge tones."
