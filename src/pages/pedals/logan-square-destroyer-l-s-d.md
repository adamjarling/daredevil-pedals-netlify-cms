Silicon transistors, volume and gain. Simple, straight forward vintage style fuzz box with modern power.  Rolling back the gain opens up the fuzz, this is where you can find some retro garage type sounds. Cranking it up will lead you to thick and destructive high gain fuzz. Great for lower tunings, creamy sustain driven leads, or searing riffage.

Big, Loud, Fuzzy. The LSD covers a lot of sonic ground while keeping things simple. Open wide, enjoy the ride. Hand wired, true bypass, 9V DC jack

"the LSD is AMAZING!...just blew my mind. I'm playing it with a Fender 6 bass and it's dangerous!" - Tim LeVebvre ( David Bowie, Derek Trucks, etc)

"I've been through a million fuzzes and the LSD is THE one for me. Great work! " - Steve R.
