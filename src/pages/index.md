    Daredevil Pedals are hand built by Johnny Wator in Chicago,

    a Fuzz junkie designing original circuits with a nod to classic tones. 

    Boost, Drive, Delay, Fuzz, and the infamous Atomic Cocked Wah...are all born
    from the experience of almost 20 years as a touring musician and recording
    over a dozen albums. Daredevil is the quest for tones blasting inside his
    brain.  Boasting high build quality, great customer service, and a
    dedication to real deal rock n roll... this is the brand of the pros,
    beginners, and everyone in between.
