#### Words from the people...

"Just an absolute beast of a bass fuzz pedal. Keeps the low end great and still has incredible fuzz sound. Mr. Wator, great job with this pedal. Shipping was quick. Excellent experience." - Ken F. 

"This is my 1st Daredevil pedal. Sounds amazing! Well made and overall i'm very pleased! Will be looking into more pedals from this maker for sure!" -Adam R. 

"Best fuzzes out there!" - David P. 

"Amazing pedal, love the tweakable low end, can go from lovely little distortion to a massive and brutal fuzz. Noise gate does its job, very useful if you add layers and layers of OD and boost before the Diasho. Daredevil's crew is very reactive, a huge thank you guys!!" - Hugo C. 

"Great pedal as usual from Daredevil, shipped quick. Thanks Johnny!" -Jeff M.

"OMG...Fanstastic pedal!  Believe the Hype on this one..." -Chris W.

"Iâ€™m writing to let you know how much I love my Daisho fuzz. Being a fuzzoholic I was looking for something different to add to my board. The quality is top notch and the sound is truly inspiring." -D.M.

"Hey, the Real Cool Fuzz is absolutely the wickedest out there. I used it for every track on the new record. You are masterful!" - the Yowl
